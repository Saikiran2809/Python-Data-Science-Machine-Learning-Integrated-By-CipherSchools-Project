# Python-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Integrated---Hybrid
# Customer Segmentation for a retail Store using Python

# Introduction:
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a retail store to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm, this analysis aims to identify distinct customer segments. These insights enable the retail store to tailor its marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance overall customer satisfaction and revenue.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the "Mall Customers" dataset, which contains demographic and behavioral information about customers, including:

# Customer ID: 
Unique identifier for each customer.

# Gender: 
Gender of the customer (Male/Female).

# Age: 
Age of the customer.

# Annual Income (k$): 
Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.

# Spending Score (1-100): 
Spending score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

# Key Features:

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Understanding the distribution and relationships within the data.

# K-Means Clustering: 
Segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors.

# Visualization: 
Using Matplotlib and Power BI to create visual representations of the data and clustering results.

# Tools and Libraries:
  # Python: 
    Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
  # Visualization: 
    Power BI

# Conclusion:
By analyzing customer data and identifying distinct segments, this project helps retail stores implement more effective marketing strategies, improve operational efficiency, and achieve a competitive advantage in the market.
